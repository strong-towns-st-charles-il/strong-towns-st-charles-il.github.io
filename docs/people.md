# Our people

We are a voluntary group of concerned citizen in the Fox Valley. 

<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/pic09.jpg %}" width="200" height="200" alt="" /></span><h3>Steve Mahon</h3>Steve is the <b>Local Conversations Leader</b> for the St. Charles Strong Towns group.
Stephen is a first-generation immigrant to the United States. Originally from Ireland, he moved to the US in 2020 during Covid-19 with his wife; a St. Charles native, and two boys. Steve has degrees in physics, chemistry, and a PhD in Engineering. He runs an e-commerce business and a tech start-up, and manages an engineering and manufacturing consultancy.
<blockquote>"I started having Strong Towns conversations because I want to live in a safe, livable, and inviting city. I believe St Charles can provide the best opportunities for my family and me." </blockquote>
