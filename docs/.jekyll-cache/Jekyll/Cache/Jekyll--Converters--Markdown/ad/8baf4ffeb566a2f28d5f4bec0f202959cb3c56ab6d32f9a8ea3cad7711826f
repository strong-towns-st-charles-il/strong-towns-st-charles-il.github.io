<h2 id="why-did-we-have-a-forum">Why did we have a Forum</h2>
<p>Over the last few months the city of St. Charles has been petitioning it citizens for thoughts and prespectives on an updated five-year Stragetic plan.
There has been meetings, interviews, vision forums, 
So this meeting was primarily a high-level requirements definition in project management. After capturing lots of information through interviews, forums, and community engagement tools with various stakeholders, the consulting company, BerryDunn, synthesized all the information into a draft project plan for a community review. The project plan included the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a mission statement,</li>
  <li>a vision statement,</li>
  <li>guiding principles,</li>
  <li>strategic priorities,</li>
  <li>and objectives for these priorities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="balance-and-services">Balance and Services</h2>
<p>The city had these statements and objectives printed on large pages in spots around the room. There were markers and post-it notes available for use.
The conversation during the forum was about the language in the project plan rather than the substance of the priorities. Discussing the wording of the 11-word mission statement took almost 30 minutes, for example. Many people want to be heard and say something, which these forums are for.
The objectives of the strategic priorities were left as a more interactive endeavor. we roamed the room, engaging in conversation and saying our bit about what we thought of the priorities and objectives.</p>
