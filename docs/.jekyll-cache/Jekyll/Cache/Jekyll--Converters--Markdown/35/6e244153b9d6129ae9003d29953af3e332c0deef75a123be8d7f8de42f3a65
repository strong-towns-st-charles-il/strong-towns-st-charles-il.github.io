<h2 id="why-did-we-have-a-forum">Why did we have a Forum</h2>
<p>Over the last few months the city of St. Charles has been petitioning it citizens for thoughts and prespectives on an updated five-year Stragetic plan.
There has been meetings, interviews, vision forums, surveys, planning sessions, community feedback events, and online engagement tools in preparation for an initial draft.
This meeting was primarily a high-level requirements definition for the project capturing the requirments of the various stakeholders (citizens, business owners, electect officials and city staff). 
The consulting company, <a href="https://www.berrydunn.com/">BerryDunn</a>, synthesized all information into a draft project plan for a community review.
The project plan included the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a mission statement,</li>
  <li>a vision statement,</li>
  <li>guiding principles,</li>
  <li>strategic priorities,</li>
  <li>and objectives for these priorities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="balance-and-growth">Balance and Growth</h2>
<p>The theme of the evening was balance and growth.
It was clear from the concerns of present citizens the importance of historic and natural resource preseveration of St. Charles.
The key for the city is to balance redevelopment while maintaining the other focuse area of the community vision.
Topics of housing and transport, business diversity, community and ammenities are also part of the discussion but sustainability and preseveration dominated the conversations.</p>

<p>The city had these statements and objectives printed on large pages in spots around the room. There were markers and post-it notes available for use.
The conversation during the forum was about the language in the project plan rather than the substance of the priorities.
Discussing the wording of the 11-word mission statement took almost 30 minutes, for example. 
Many people want to be heard and say something, which these forums are for.
The objectives of the strategic priorities were left as a more interactive endeavor.
We roamed the room, engaging in conversation and saying our bit on the priorities and objectives of the city.</p>
