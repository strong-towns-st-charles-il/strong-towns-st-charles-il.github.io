<p>So this meeting was primarily a high-level requirements definition in project management. After capturing lots of information through interviews, forums, and community engagement tools with various stakeholders, the consulting company, BerryDunn, synthesized all the information into a draft project plan for a community review. The project plan included the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a mission statement,</li>
  <li>a vision statement,</li>
  <li>guiding principles,</li>
  <li>strategic priorities,</li>
  <li>and objectives for these priorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve attached the draft plan, as well as the slide deck for the presentation. See also the project page for feedback: https://berrydunn.mysocialpinpoint.com/city-of-st-charles-il/project-page</p>
